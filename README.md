## To deploy

To deploy YOUR version of **Azure Url Shortener** you could fork this repo, but if you are looking for the easy way just click on the "Deploy to Azure".

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/?WT.mc_id=urlshortener-github-frbouche#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FFBoucher%2FAzUrlShortener%2Fmaster%2Fdeployment%2FazureDeploy.json)

This will open the Azure Portal (portal.azure.com) in your subscription and create the required resources.

![createARM][createARM]

- **Resource group**: Logical group where your resources will be created.
- **Location**: Select a location (usually closer of your users)
- **Base Name**: This is how you would like to named your resources. Because some names need to be globally unique, the deployment will generate a suffix and append it to the end of your Base name.
- **GitHub URL and Branch**: Keep the default if you when to deploy from Frank's master repo. 
- **Expire On and Owner Name**: Those value are for tags. They **won't affect** in any cases your deployment. I use it in another project ([AzSubscriptionCleaner](https://github.com/FBoucher/AzSubscriptionCleaner)) to clean my subscription; without this project it's just information.

Once all the resources are created you will end-up with: 

- Azure Function: Where the code from the project [src/shortenerTools](src/shortenerTools) will be copy.
- Service Plan: Dynamic service plan (aka. [Consumption Plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/functions/?WT.mc_id=azurlshortener-github-frbouche)) to make sure you are only charged on a per-second granularity.
- Application Insights: To get some metric/ usage of our function. (In the future we could interface that information in a friendly web UI)
- 2 Storage account: 1 for the Azure Function, the second use as Data Storage leveraging the [Azure Table storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/tables/?WT.mc_id=azurlshortener-github-frbouche).

### Post deployment configuration

Add a custom domain to your Azure Function. (coming soon)
(or check [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-custom-domain?WT.mc_id=azurlshortener-github-frbouche))

[See the complete list of admin interfaces here](src/adminTools/README.md)

### How to get the Azure Function URLs?

To find the URLs of you two functions go to the Azure Portal (portal.azure.com), and open the Azure Function inside the resource created previously.

![getURL][getURL]

Expend the Functions section from the left menu, and click on the Function **UrlRedirect** (1). Then click on the **</> Get function URL** (2) button. And finally, click the **Copy** button to get the URL of your function with the security token. Repeat for the function **UrlShortener**.


> **Note:** To run it the Azure Function locally, you will need to create a `local.settings.json` file at the root of the project. Here what the file should look like.
> ```
> {
>   "IsEncrypted": false,
>   "Values": {
>     "AzureWebJobsStorage": "CONNSTR_TO_shortenertools",
>     "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet",
>     "FUNCTIONS_V2_COMPATIBILITY_MODE":"true",
>     "UlsDataStorage":"CONNSTR_TO_urldata"
>   }
> }
> ```
